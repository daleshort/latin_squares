# Flask Backend + React Frontend

This is a working example of sending a request from React via a button onClick to a python script through Flask.  Each button will generate a JSON file which is a valid sudoku board.

# How to use

In 'backend/Sudoku', run 'npm run start-api'.  Then we need to launch React with 'npm start'.

Another way to do this would be to start the api with 'python app.py' in the api folder, and then do an 'npm start'.

This should get things up and running!  You might have to install a virtual environment.
